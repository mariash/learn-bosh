<%= circled_title(2, "Failing VM") %>

<p>What if there is a problem with instance that is running our service? BOSH offers manual and automatic recovery when there are problems with infrastructure resources like VMs or disks. In this exercise we are going to kill one of our instances and use manual recovery option.</p>

<p>bosh-lite is using <b>Warden</b> to manage deployments. Warden is a Linux container management tool. Each container represents one instance. On vagrant VM kill one of Warden containers:</p>

<div class="terminal-block">
  <h4 class="terminal-code-text">$ vagrant ssh</h4>
  <h4 class="terminal-code-text">vagrant@agent-id-bosh-0$ wget -qO - http://127.0.0.1:7777/containers</h4>
  <h4 class="terminal-printout-text">{"handles":["id-1","id-2"]}</h4>
  <h4 class="terminal-code-text">vagrant@agent-id-bosh-0$ wget -qO - --method=DELETE http://127.0.0.1:7777/containers/id-1</h4>
</div>

<p>Let's see that one of the instances is in a bad state:</p>

<div class="terminal-block">
  <h4 class="terminal-code-text">$ bosh -e lite instances</h4>
  <h4 class="terminal-printout-text">...
Instance    Process State       IPs
app/guid-1  running             10.244.0.6
app/guid-2  unresponsive agent  10.244.0.2
...</h4>
</div>

<p>One of the components in BOSH is the Health Monitor. It independently watches system health and will bring missing instances back up by instructing infrastructure to recreate missing resources like VMs with the required persistent disk. Keep running <b>bosh -e lite instances</b> and see that instance is brought up and service is running eventually.</p>

<p>Now let's turn off automatic repair and manually resolve the issue.</p>

<div class="terminal-block">
  <h4 class="terminal-code-text">$ bosh -e lite update-resurrection off</h4>
</div>

<p>Kill one of the containers again as described above. Run cloud check and select option "Recreate VM and wait for processes to start".</p>

<div class="terminal-block">
  <h4 class="terminal-code-text">$ bosh -e lite -d learn-bosh cloud-check</h4>
</div>

<p>Cloud check command allows to manually resolve issues when resources (VMs and persistent disks) are in a bad state. Run <b>bosh -e lite instances</b> to see all instances running again.</p>
